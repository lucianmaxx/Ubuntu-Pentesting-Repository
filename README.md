# Frequently Ask Question:
- Is it legal ?

Sure, every each package using Debian Format LICENSE from each source github repository

- Can i use it with some illegal action ?

Every project or source package didn't want to use it with illegal action but it's not our warranty because the project only for education.

- Why there's no forensics tools ?

In ubuntu there's meta-packages that install all forensics tools (forensics-full) in Ubuntu Repository, like volatility framework, ddrescue, exif, etc.
